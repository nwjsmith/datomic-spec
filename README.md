# spec.datomic

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nwjsmith/spec.datomic/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nwjsmith/spec.datomic/tree/master)

`clojure.spec` specs for Datomic's query data. **Note** this is under active development, so you will get very little use out of it right now.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[com.theinternate.spec.datomic :as datomic-spec])
(require '[clojure.spec :as s])
(s/valid? ::datomic-spec/query '{:find [?e]
                                 :in [$ ?fname ?lname]
                                 :where [[?e :user/firstName ?fname]
                                         [?e :user/lastName ?lname]]})
;; => true
(s/valid? ::datomic-spec/query '[:find [?name ...]
                                 :in $ ?artist
                                 :where [?release :release/name ?name]
                                        [?release :release/artists ?artist]])
;; => true

(s/valid? ::datomic-spec/query '[:find ?e
                                 :inputs $ ?artist
                                 :where [?e :release/artists ?artist]])
;; => false
```
